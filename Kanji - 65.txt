Incompetence strikes once again! And there's a couple of nasty ones in here, so I'm unfortunately a bit sparse on words.

I guess this is a pictogram for some guy sitting on a saddle?

Pictograms!

I would not be surprised if this had a history almost completely unrelated to 鳥.

I don't think I need to explain this one.

Thanks to Iso, this can actually make a lot of sense, if you consider that 壴 is "drum" and 口 "laughter". So basically a feast where people rejoice.

You're gonna be stoked if you have some nice ladies at the feast. I guess.

If only this had been ⿱豆貝, it would've looked like a pictogram again. Oh well, I guess now it's just a decapitated guy.

Each summer I get a sunburn on my head.

More words I didn't know and I love it.

Stubborn people often try to be too original (in their heads).

At a summit on the peak (nail) of a mountain, the big heads of our countries discuss politics? Eurgh.

At least this one has something related to money in it.
