OH MAN, I'M SURE NOT GONNA MISTAKE THIS FOR 熊. Both look squiggly and the only discernable thing is the fire at the bottom. Balls. I'm pretty sure I don't even remember 25% of the characters I've learned up until now. I'm gonna fail so hard at this challenge, it's not even funny.

You can't hide it forever! Admit it and speak the truth!
