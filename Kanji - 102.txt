Today we reach 1400. Not much left to go!

float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1392){雰}}}
You must understand, rain can only happen in an atmosphere!

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1393){露}}}
Outdoors is where it rains on the roads.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1394){业}}}
This actually means "profession, business" and I'll take it, even though it's not super helpful this time.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1395){霊}}}
The profession of a ghost is to haunt you in the rain.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1396){湿}}}
The profession of water is to moisten everything.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1397){業}}}
A business has the profession of trying to grow Yen on trees.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1398){僕}}}
All men are business people, obviously.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1399){撲}}}
The work(hand) of any business is to eradicate their competition!

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1400){}}}
This one unfortunately doesn't have a wiktionary entry, so I'll just take Kanjidamage's suggestion.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1402){滝}}}
A waterfall looks like a dragon made of water.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1403){電}}}
Dragons in the rain clouds are lightning bolts and therefore electricity! I love this one.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1404){俺}}}
If you are a big person stronger than a dragon you'll use this way of saying "I".

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1405){亀}}}
I don't understand why Kanjidamage didn't choose the composition of "Hook + Turtle Shell + Dragon" here, as it's much more helpful.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1406){縄}}}


endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1407){而}}}
The meaning of this is actually "and, and then, and yet, but". I'll take it over Kanjidamage's suggestion since it's just as useful as a compound (almost not at all), but is the actual meaning. Note though that it is not used as such in Japanese, as far as I'm aware.

And now we enter the final phases.
