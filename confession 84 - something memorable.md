I opened the door to the local coffee shop, "Alpha". Immediately, a strong coffee fragrance enveloped me. The shop appeared mostly empty, a few lonely customers minding their own business on the side. The barista shot me a quick glance before returning her attention to a ruffled magazine. I'm not sure if it was just my perception at the time, but the shop appeared extraordinarily quiet, especially compared to the droning of the sandstorm just outside. All I could hear now was the chime of the doorbell slowly ringing out and the low grumble of the water cookers below the bar. I stood there for a brief moment, taking in the atmosphere. A million specks of dust shone in the beam of light shining through the door window and I would bet that I could see the smell of the coffee swirl about in the air.

As I stood there I also took a closer look at the locals in the shop. At the far corner sat an old codger with eyebrows so thick you could hardly make out whether he was actually awake or not. A few rows before him sat an older couple. The one of the two that resembled a woman in some sense shot daggers at me over her knitting. The man with a wide set of shoulders had his back turned towards me. He seemed to be invested in an outdated copy of the town's irregularly published newspaper. The barista herself was a tall piece of work. Slender figure, dark complexion, rough appearance. You could swear that she reeked of cigarettes, if it weren't for the overpowering smell of coffee. Her outfit had seen better days, but then again, everything in this town had.

I strode forward to the counter. The barista glanced at me again briefly, threw the magazine to the side and leaned onto the counter. "What will it be?" she asked, staring me plain in the face. Her expression was completely flat. It was the kind you only see with people that have, although begrudgingly, completely settled in their routine. The kind that would just do their job, get back home, and repeat without giving it any more thought than that. The kind that was trustworthy, if perhaps not very cooperative. I pointed to the blue emblem on my uniform and smiled. She stared at it for a moment, then back directly at me. "You're not having anything then." "Maybe later. I'm here about the posting." Suddenly, wide-shoulders broke out into a coughing fit and stared at me wide-eyed. After he recovered he blurted out "You can't-" before his wife shut him up with an angry glare. He quickly regained his composure and tried to pretend none of that had happened. "Can you give me the details of what happened?" I continued, "The posting was rather brief." "Sure. Come with me." The barista took me through a short corridor into the back room.

The back room was musty, the air heavy with dust and cigarette smoke. A single bulb dangling from the ceiling dimly lit it up, bathing everything in a soft yellow. The room was outfitted with a run-down desk, a bookshelf stuffed to the brim with magazines and documents, two chairs, and a small iron safe. On the desk lay an open HC-50 workstation, various parts of its interior electronics spread about. The barista followed my glance. "I like to tinker," she said, a dash of colour appearing on her face. "My name's Fi, by the way". She quickly turned and grabbed a book out of the shelf, and handed it to me. "Here. Should be in the back." I flipped through the pages. They were photos of this room, each labelled with a date. Most photos only showed Fi, with the dates jumping ahead days and months at a time. The last few photos however were only seconds apart. They showed a strange figure in a dark trench coat with a wide-brimmed hat obscuring the head and face. The figure moved around the room, seemingly searching for something. About ten minutes later, judging by the timestamps, the figure left again. Nothing else in the pictures appeared to have changed.

I looked at Fi quizzically. "And?" "Odd, right? For a while I thought it was just some weirdo looking for anything to nick, but then... I found this." Fi picked something up from the ground and tossed it to me. It was a small, grey cube. "A transmitter, huh. Interesting" I remarked, studying the little device. "I don't suppose you do anything in here that would be worth the trouble of planting this?" "No idea. I don't keep much company. Tending to the shop is enough for me, so I mostly keep to myself otherwise." "Hm." I had another look around the room. Indeed, everything still looked much the same as in the photos; nothing obvious was missing or different. "The next question would be if you remember any people that fit the description," I looked back at the photos, "though being as obvious as that I'm sure you would have mentioned it." "Yeah, never seen anyone like that." "Are there any other entrances?" "There is a back entrance, but I keep it locked at all times." "Where were you at the time?" "I'm not too sure. I only discovered this a few days after it happened. I might have left the shop for a few minutes around this time, though." "Do you remember who was in the cafe on that day?" "Yeah- the same regulars as now, as well as a drifter." "Can you describe the drifter to me?" "Medium height, very skinny. Thick glasses and dressed like a dork. Had a big backpack full of stuff." "How long did he stay?" "About an hour or so, I wager." "... O-key," I scratched my head, "I suppose I should have a word with the rest."

Fi and I went back to the shop. A new guest was impatiently tapping his fingers on the counter. Fi went on to business, and I tried to make up my mind about how I wanted to approach this. The outburst from the burly man certainly seemed suspicious, but I wasn't ready to jump to any conclusions quite yet. The thought of having to deal with his wife however convinced me to start with the old geezer in the back first. I sat down opposite of him and put on my most convincing smile. "May I have a few words with you?" "Wuh?" the man looked around himself in confusion, big eyes shining from beneath his eyebrows. "Listen, old timer. I have some questions for you." "Oh yeah?" "Yeah. You don't seem to be in a hurry so I'm sure you have some time to answer them. Do you come here often?" "I ain't done nothin'." "Oh come on, I'm just trying to help Fi out. You like this shop, right?" The man grumbled. "So what if I do." "So you tell me what I want to know and I'll be out of here in no time flat." The man said nothing, but his eyes tried to burn a hole through my face. I continued on.

"You were here last Friday. Do you remember who else was in the cafe at the time?" The man paused for a while before replying. "Yeah. 'side from Fi and me the two over there were also here. Making a right racket they were." "What about?" "Hell if I know, I was just tryin' to have my peace." He avoided my gaze. "Don't care for gossip." "Was there anyone else?" "No." I figured I wasn't going to get anything more useful out of him. "Al-right. Thank you for your time," I put on my best smile again and got up. Something was clearly amiss. The customer from earlier had since gotten his filling and sat in the row between the couple and the geezer. I took a closer look at him. Tall, gruff, dirty uniform, probably a construction worker. Fi had returned to her magazine and didn't seem to pay anyone any mind.


Idea: 
- wife thinks man is cheating on her with fi, so is now going to coffee shop with him
- man is worried stranger is here because of him
- wife planted transmitter to spy on her
