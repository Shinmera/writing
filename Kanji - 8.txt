I'm ludicrously tired today and I didn't get to study my Kanji according to plan because I screwed things up at work and didn't get my usual lunch break. Regardless, time for Kanji... *sigh*

Ok, so... fuckin' neighborhood or whatever. Sort of looks like a road next to a rice field and the white space is houses or something. Good enough for me.

The fireleft symbol always looks like a dude running to me. So I guess he's running over the field, cultivating it with seeds 'n shit. Oddly enough no Onyomi is listed for this. Fine by me though.

The rice field looks sorta like a chest and the moon looks like the stomach and legs. He got decapitated though. Poor guy.

This thing's a bitch because it looks nothing like what it describes at all and is very similar with person. When I saw this symbol, I went "nyuuu, do not want!". Then I just put it in my ass and learned it. Sometimes you just gotta do it.

Looks like someone photographed the legs of an acrobat that does these weird bending stunts or whatever. Disgusting shit. But whatever, symbol's easy enough to remember because it looks fucking easy.

何これ？！

I believe this is a shit word. Why? Because people always say they believe in stuff (that was a mnemonic btw). Stop believing, you asshats, and stick to the things you know for certain.

Interesting that the Kunyomi form of this is only used to describe people turning into ghosts or some shit. I'd guess there's another word to describe people changing in some way or another then.

And that's it for today.
Sorry that I'm so grumpy and rude or whatever, but I'm tired as hell and just want to get this out before I go back to crying into my pillow, or whatever it is sad people do nowadays.
