The world is a quite marvellous. Marvellous, because it has so many things to offer, both for the url(http://jinzhan.deviantart.com/art/Afternoon-Tea-Time-260324890){really disturbingly unpleasant things} that scare you to the point that not even the dust clouds undearneath your bed appear threatening; as well as the sort of url(http://www.sublimetext.com/){stuff you fall in love with immediately} and want to spend the rest of your life with. How these things balance each other doesn't really depend on what happens to us (despite what some people would like to believe), but rather on what you make out of it and how important you deem them. Regardless of whether you have a shitty day because you just stubbed your toe into the corner of a wall with the might of a wrestler or if your day is extremely good because you just url(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3JwS4RcYyk){won the lottery}, I'm not here to talk about attitudes today. I'll just lose a few words about something that I've recently fallen in love with.

Bastion is a game developed by url(http://supergiantgames.com/){Supergiant Games}, yet another indie team. I'm having a hard time describing what makes this game as good as I think it is, because it all just fits so well together that I can't really find a place to start. Despite this, I suppose I'll just start with the most special feature of Bastion, which is the narrator. Throughout the game you listen to a narrator that gives you back-story and additional information about what's currently going on. The narrative adapts to the way you play and the things you do, which helps a lot to get immersed into the game. What Supergiant got absolutely spot-on with the narrator, is a way to provide lots of story into the game, without disturbing its flow at all. You never have to stop and it's never intrusive, so you can keep on playing and listen to the fantastic voice as you go.
Just give it a try.

Isn't that just the kind of voice you'd like to hear when camping out in the desert, sitting around a campfire and thinking about all the matters in the world, both good and bad; just pondering with your thoughts and letting them float through the starry night sky.
Ok, granted, that scenario is pretty damn unlikely for a city-face like me, but we'll imagine for now.

I find Bastion to be another game like Okami. It gets the artwork, gameplay and soundtrack just perfectly matched up. As such, this both means that the game would only be half as good if any of the things were missing, but it also means that they all are fantastic. The soundtrack has some really spectacular tunes, especially the ending theme, the artwork is lovely and often times just stunning to look at and the game plays really well, keeps you interested and deeply invested in the story, characters and developments.

At its core, the game is an action RPG, the RPG elements mainly consisting of the weapons you choose to fight and eventually level up. Another element are spirits, which give you passive bonuses during the game. There's also a variety of items scattered throughout the world that give you more insight about the backstory, once you talk to the Narrator about them. The story itself plays after an event referred to as the "Calamity", which tore the world to pieces and killed almost everyone in the process. As a survivor, you travel around the individual pieces of the world that have been shot up into the sky and try to find the cores that keep these parts from falling apart. With the cores, you can improve the strength of your new home, the Bastion. I won't say any more about it though, as it would just ruin so much of it, if I tried to retell it in any other way than the original way it was intended to be heard.

Bastion does have its own set of problems of course. Just the same as the food that lands on your plate in a five star super luxury gourm√©t restaurant is extremely good and close to perfect, there's always some wanker out there who'll find a way to complain about i{something}. So, obviously, there are some complaints I have about this game, despite it being such a delicious dish. My first complaint is about the linux version of it. This might just be my machine, my setup or whatever the hell I'm doing wrong, but it sometimes just freezes completely, and since it captures the mouse and keyboard, I can't do anything with my machine anymore, except press the power button. The freezes appear to be completely random and I have no clue what's causing them, but yeah. It was quite frustrating because it ripped me out of such a grand experience every time. Don't worry though, all the other complaints I have actually concern the game, so I'll stop my excessive geekery, at least for now. My other complaint is that the collision detection for the objects and ground is only sub-optimal. Often times there's places where I didn't think I could stand on, but could and other places that showed the reverse phenomenon. The hitboxes of the enemies are sometimes a bit weird as well, so I'd wager the collision detection system could've used some more work. Aside from that, I have nothing to complain about this game at all. Yep, that's it already!

Now, the url(http://store.supergiantgames.com/){Supergiant Store} has some sweet Bastion merchandise to offer, of which I bought the collection pack. Here's some pictures that look worse than if they were shot by a camera from 15 years ago, but they'll have to do. It's late and my room is about as well lit as a cave in minecraft, so I apologize for the quality.
