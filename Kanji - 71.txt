It is astounding how completely different this symbol looks in different fontsets. On my Windows machine at work (where I made the cards), the bottom part looks like マ and here it looks like 卩.

An alarm bell (an old fashioned one that is an actual bell) can look golden and it issues a command to open the door? Maybe?

This one confused me when I was studying at work because the symbol on the right is 卩 in both font sets, while the change was reflected for all other symbols.

At least the actual Kanji does mean 'cold' too, so this isn't completely backwards for once.
