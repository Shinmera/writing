# A Red Button
There's a popular thought experiment that goes something like this: if you were presented with a big red button that, when pressed, would randomly kill someone on earth, but you were given a million dollars or whatever other amount of money to press it, would you do it?

I've always found that experiment to be rather blas√©. After all, the chances of killing anyone you know are slimmer than anyone you know just dying in a random accident today, with even less of an involvement from yourself. So, of course you'd take the money. Many would probably press the button just for the thrill of it or for some metaphysical justification, with no other reward at all.

So if you really think about it, without explaining the mechanism by which the person dies, nor the mechanism by which the person to die is selected, the moral conundrum is kind of moot. The way the experiment is stated, it is implied that the person just drops dead instantly which sounds very unproblematic, nice even. Heck, even if you changed the experiment to kill the one pressing the button instantly, I'm sure there'd be innumerable people that would press it right away.

The results of the experiment would change far more drastically if the person to die suffered in some way. And I'm just as sure the results would change the other way if the selection of the people to die was specified to, say, only pick the richest capitalist pigs alive. To be honest with you, in the latter case I'd be hitting that button over and over again until my fingers bled.
