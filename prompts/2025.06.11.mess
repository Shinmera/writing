# Day at the Beach
I awoke to find myself standing on a sandy beach. The sun was setting slowly, creating a mesmerising, shimmering gradient of orange at the horizon, bathing everything in a soft, warm orange glow. The sky was mostly clear, with a few lone clouds dotting it here and there like stray sheep. The sand glistened, and I could feel its coarse but pleasant texture through the soles of my feet.

Waves slowly reached towards me and faded back, overlapping each other, crashing over each other, merging with each other, splitting from one another, every interaction leaving its own pattern of seafoam behind which disappeared into another wave as quickly as it had appeared.

A faint wind blew through my hair, and along with the gentle waves it produced an entrancing sound pattern, an endless pattern of "sshaaaaa", "ssshhhh", "shaaaaaa", which never repeated itself exactly, leaving me to keep listening for it, waiting for the next wave to bring its own, unique melody.

Then a particularly energetic and daring wave reached all the way up to my feet, briefly enveloping them in the cool ocean water, tickling the skin. As it receded, a new sound was added to the ocean melody, faint as it may have been. The sand prickled and popped softly, lending a new dimension to the experience.

I thought of all the grains of sand that were pushed around by each wave, the millions and billions of imperceptible interactions that were necessary to create this sound, this view, this very existence that I was now witness to. But of course I could not, so I quickly returned the feeble grasp of my attention to experiencing the world in the only way I could, just the way I had been presented.
