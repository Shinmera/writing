I'll be honest. I'm not someone who likes to url(http://blog.tymoon.eu/p/63-Travel_Event_2012){travel}, or traverse any large distances for the matter. My home is way too comfortable and Zürich is just too convenient for me to really have a desire to be anywhere else but this city. You might argue that even a url(http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/archive_page.php?comicID=562){city face} like myself sometimes has the urge to see something new and exciting, get some different views, see other parts of the world! Because, after all, I might, just i{might}, discover something that I like and find interesting, right?

Well, it's just that I don't even care about that. I don't need to see something new. I have enough things to discover work-wise. There's so much to do for me that going some place else just merely serves as a distraction that interrupts my work flow and makes my schedules even later than they already are. This probably makes me sound like your next best internet addict or something, but it's really not the case here. I do realize very well that most of my work is done on the computer, but there's just not really any other way to do programming, now is there? I can do very well without any internet access or without any computer to use, if I decide so for myself and it isn't url(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mfA1jNiqoU){my ISP doing the decision for me} just for the sake of it.

Whichever way it may be, there is one place that I really like to visit and do so almost every year (and there isn't even any internet access available! Oh lord the horrors). It's a rather small and tourist-y town in Italy called 'url(http://goo.gl/maps/GDZGi){Forte dei Marmi}'. I usually visit it with my parents during fall and I've always enjoyed being there. The town is really charming, the sea and beach are really nice (albeit sometimes awfully cold) and there's at least url(http://goo.gl/maps/dov1u){a dozen pizzerias} and pizza stands that all serve class A+++ pizzas, would eat again.

Yep, that's it. Nothing else to see here!
No, I'm serious, that's all I like about it and all I need to like about it. Now you might think that there's got to be other places that I might like as well, if not better, if that's all it takes for me to be happy. And I agree! I'm quite sure there are and I just haven't seen them yet. Nevertheless, this is url(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_good_enough){Good Enough™} and good enough is... well, good enough. There simply is no reason for me to look further because travelling is always a huge chore for me, so the risk involved is too great. It's actually rather fortunate that I stumbled upon this town at all and if it weren't for my parents, I probably never would have. I doubt I would care all that much though, since my home is good enough as well.

It's that time of the year again, and I'm going to go to Forte dei Marmi for about a week and a half. Which means I'll be completely absent from the internet from the 6.10.12 to the 16.10.12. While I'm there I'll hopefully remember to take more pictures this time, url(http://stevenarch.tymoon.eu/ga/res/1312.html){unlike last year}... I'll also take my Lisp book and one of my compiler books with me, so I can get back to studying those. Of course, I'll also continue my daily Japanese studies. More on that another time though, as those are fairly large topics that I don't want to chew on right now. Either way, I hope you enjoy your quick break url(https://twitter.com/Shinmera/status/252535022165311491){from myself} and I'll be back sooner than you want to believe!
