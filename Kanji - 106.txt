The woman(cat) dropped her cloth on the field. How obscene!

Monkeys are far away living cats.

If you can't protect the cats, hunt them.

It was believed that the king with all those cats went mad.

There was a solitary cat living with insects.

Cats and dogs living together? We must be in hell.

The cat laid prey on the turkey in the bushes.

It's a narrow path ahead if you want to take your cat as your husband...

So this one is (in Kanjidamage's view) two in one, even though they're technically two different symbols. It appears though that the first one is obsolete and only used for names, if I understand it correctly. Either way, they actually mean "joint, seal" which is by far not as useful as "fingerprint" is, so I'll go with Kanjidamage's suggestion here.

If you want to commit a crime like a cat, you need not leave any fingerprints!

Hrm.

Slap him on his mouth with your hand(fingerprint).

Neither of those are the compounds he's listing. It's not too bad though, as it's symbolic enough to be able to recognize it without compounds.

You need to disregard the fingerprints that are too far in the past.

The standard is to build cars out of bamboo.
