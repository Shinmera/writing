I ran out of cards at home and only found another stack of the really thin ones, which my marker shows through. Dammit.

It kind of maybe sorta looks like an M for "Mr."?

He forgot the 一 at the bottom.

There's a surprising amount of things called かみ. God, paper, hair, directory, seasoning. How lucky that they all have different Kanji to describe them.

The 一 strikes back. I guess he leaves it out because it's part of the 氏 sometimes, or what's going on here?

Woman + "Mr." + altar looking table = Marriage

And more of the 一. On fruther inspection, wiktionary tells me that there's a 氐, which is different from 氏. I guess Kanjidamage just bundles those together.

I don't like how he merges the two Kanji together here.

When the people get sleepy, they close their eyes.

And that's it for the weekend.
