Movie night and other stuff made me late.

I'm really confused why he decided NOT to take the actual meaning for this Kanji ('holy','sacred'), as it makes much more sense for the compounts as well.

Holy and supernatural things are usually associated with lightness. At least in Western culture, so it works for me.

The 'holy' doesn't really help here, but it's still better than 'take a dump'.

Interesting that this only works as an adjective, if Kanjidamage can be trusted.

I'm guessing that this is/was something symbolic again. "Hand" makes sense for "extract", but "friend" doesn't.

Well, it's been pretty much throughout all western history that the male character ends up being the hero. I don't think they were ever progressive enough to have female heroes as well and I don't imagine that being all too different in eastern countries.

More later today.
