I can't remember this one for the life of me.

Clever vassals don't fight, they deal with money. ... And then get murdered by some gangster group.

I'm kind of thinking about writing my own CMS for this and create an improved version of Kanjidamage, as that site has a couple of things that irk me. It probably won't happen any soon though, as I simply lack the time to do it.
