The only Kanji I want to learn at the moment is the one for "tiredness" or "being tired" (疲).

It's always surprising to me when I realize just how many different words we have to describe all the little nuances between how something is done (shout, exclaim, cry, etc. as an example).

Another thing about this (and the previous one) is that in the other font I use at work for my browser, the 四 in this symbol looks more like 穴 (without the dot), which is quite confusing.

...Why does the composition on Kanjidamage say it's "rifle" here, even though it's clearly "fishhook"?

Hm. How old is this symbol?

On the note of singing, let me go completely off topic: I should sing more, because I hate having a (not terrible, but) not so good singing voice and I'd quite like to improve on that front as well. I just need to get over the shame barrier...

I can't help but feel that this is supposed to be a pictogram of sorts.

I still can't stop thinking about a custom CMS for this.
Maybe I'll draw up some sample layouts next weekend...
