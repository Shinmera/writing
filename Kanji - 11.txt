Contrary to what Kanjidamage says, I can actually see "again" easier in this than "crotch". Again because it's almost sort of like a loop thing? Very interesting that it can both mean "again" and "either", since those meanings aren't exactly very matching.

Do it again, woman! You are my servant after all. Anyway, sexism aside, I think it's peculiar that it's also used as a word for "chum", given it's rather... derogatory meaning.

You get it again until you have four of 'em, regardless of whether you actually need that many phones or not.
