Sometimes learning these is quite a tad more complicated due to the fact that I don't even know the English word used. This is one of the cases. It's an opportunity to expand my repertoire in English, but it makes learning the Kanji quite a bit of a pain in the buttocks.

Another odd colour. I do really like that kind of dark red though, so I appreciate this character.

I guess if you're strong at your craft, you'll be successful.

The only reason this exists seems to be Kanjidamage's "three or more times=radical" rule.

Yet another word I didn't know. Adroit even sounds very... non-english, somehow.

Bestow I at least knew, but still, it isn't exactly a word I hear often.

You'll only get a cheap mockoff crown copy!

On a different note: Does anyone know of a chrome extension that allows me to quickly look up things in wiktionary? I couldn't find anything usable on the chrome webstore, but maybe I just missed one / searched badly.

I think a big pirate hook would be more unhandy than anything to be proud of.

Oh, another counter particle thing.

Taking another peek at wiktionary... I really hope that the meaning listing isn't ordered by occurrence, because otherwise this would (most of the time) mean something very different than "ritual": "type, style"
