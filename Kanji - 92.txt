I got my workstation set up again and am not feeling stupid at the moment. What better time to do some Kanji.

A person can wound another easily with a rifle.

The earth is easily definable as "a place". Oh man!

Makes sense with the "hook" pseudo radical, but nor really as a component, unfortunately.

The lower part of this is later on said to be 𠃜}. So... why the fuck isn't it here?

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1211){免}}}
As an exemption, sometimes even humans are used as bait!

If you "exempt" the day, you get night.

Coloured strings? Literally impossible.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1215){勉}}}
Trying hard is more of an exemption than the rule.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1216){𠃜}}}
Is there a monocle Kanji too?

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1217){声}}}
Uuuh, samurais with lorgnettes have beautiful voices ? .... ???

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1218){肥}}}
And here we have the 巴 I was talking about. Apparently 巴 means "greatly desire, anxiously hope". I guess obese people's organs greatly desire food?

Oink.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1220){象}}}
Elephants are large pigs with a long hook for a nose? Idk.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1221){像}}}
The person built a statue in the elephant's image.

The roofs underneath which the pigs live are their homes.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1224){嫁}}}
The bride will soon become "a woman of the house".

Wheat => Home.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1228){隊}}}
Troups are filled with evil (horns) pigs that litter in the towns.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1229){行}}}


endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1230){徐}}}
If you don't have an excess of "go juice", you'll go very slowly!

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1232){徒}}}
And we're finally back to having the URL-ID match the actual Kanji #! Also, pupils go around and run after their masters.

I seem to have way too many stomach-aches recently.
