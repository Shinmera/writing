I get the feeling that "lack" doesn't actually mean "lack" here.

Haven't we seen this before? I'm having too many déjà vus lately.

That's quite the complex Kanji for a counter.

Excuse the useless mnemonics, I couldn't come up with anything smart to say.
Not that I often do, but anyway.

In more interesting news, I've decided to go through with my own implementation of a Kanji dictionary/learning site. However, I'll only start with that once I begin the second iteration of the sequence. It'll still be quite a while before that happens, so don't expect it any soon.
