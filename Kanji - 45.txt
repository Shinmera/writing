Forgot to write entries again, stupid me!

Hm, well, I guess if you water anything enough it'll be erased either way, so might as well be a "carrot".

How many more of these radicals am I gonna have to see?

I've had some trouble with this, despite the fact that you could see a vegetable as a "tree" that looks like a "nest" and shows "flowers". Although, now that I write it out, it sounds quite convoluted, so never mind my ramblings.

I solely remember this because of 授.

This one is an absolute cunt to remember for me. I still can't quite do it... "case"? No... oh, that's right, "compromise". God damnit.

I guess if you instruct someone to get you something you'll receive it by hand?

Was gathering eggs from nests in trees ever a common thing?

I dub thee: "Running Dog" (or whatever @isoraqathedh suggests as a better idea). It's not really logical to me why Kanjidamage didn't make a radical out of this as well and instead simply named it "each bottom", given by the fact that there's been much stupider radicals before.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/609){各}}}
With my "running dog", this reminds me of dog races. Not that I ever saw one, but I know they exist.

I've never heard of an actual crown being mass produced, so surely each crown must have its customer.

I've had a ridiculously easy time with (almost) all the 各-radicals the first time around.

Interesting to find "liquor" here. I'll be a bit disappointed if the connection is purely phonetic (if there's a connection at all).

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/620){乃}}}
On @isoraqathedh's suggestion, I will call this "pregnant" instead of "grasping hand", as Kanjidamage suggests.

I suppose in ye olden times it was much more difficult to invite people, so you had to excel at speaking to do it? Although I might just as well be completely off with my guesses on that.

Tranquility is a nice word, I really like its sound.

Is this really one of the 2000 most common Kanji?

And done for the day!
