There's too many sheep in this.

Pretty straight forward. A wild head is going crazy

I assume that these dots are (in their actual symbols) always some sort of simplification that happened over time and Kanjidamage grouped them together here.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/860){首}}}
I guess you could see it as yet another pictogram of a person and either 丷 make the neck (and the rest the body) or 目 makes the neck (and the rest the jawline).

This older brother is a real jerkface, he demands taxes on all the wheat you harvest!

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/863){説}}}
Hey, hey, bro, hey brother! Explain this to me! Come oooon!

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/864){脱}}}
The older brother depicts his superiority by showing off his organs, I guess.

The closest I can do here is another pictogram where the strokes on the right are magnetic waves or something. I would be very surprised if this was actually the case though.

I hate this kanji because there are a bunch of kanji coming up that have it as a compound and none of them have anything to do with its meaning whatsoever. 

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/868){￥}}}
Lovely to know that they use two symbols for their currency. ... WHY.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/869){南}}}
People in the south are well known for wearing 10￥ moustaches.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/870){鮮}}}
Fresh fish and sheep. I guess?

The expert on sheep tells us all about life as a shepherd.

All the people in the West across the water are sheep!

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/873){遅}}}
Moving sheep corpses are always slow and late.

Discriminate all the people on the left!

Good sheep cultivate the rear of their fields properly too.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/877){義}}}
We as sheep care a lot about righteousness.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/878){儀}}}
If you give someone righteousness, you pay them respect.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1764){議}}}
Talking with righteousness is a discussion.

I cannot imagine that someone with a sheep, a tree and water would be an important person, so this is another meaning that has absolutely nothing to do with any of its compounds.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/881){添}}}
None of these compounds have to do with appending. Another lovely Kanji.

I'll catch up with today's tomorrow since I only now did the ones for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Sorry about that by the way, I wasted all day with playing minecraft instead of being productive, so there's really only myself to blame.
