The "more later today" in the previous blog was a lie. I missed it because I had to pack... oh who am I kidding I was just a lazy faggot. Anyway, without further ado...

This actually means "Third". More specifically, the third of the ten heavenly stems. Makes just as much sense as "t-bone steak" to me, so why not.

After at least the third tree, a pattern can emerge.

I like this one because it builds quite easy Kanji.

If at least three people feel sick, there's probably a sickness going around.

When people walk the path of sickness, they'll scream いたい！ often.

When you get tired from hard work, you can feel it on your skin.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1350){痢}}}
Diarrhea is a sickness you can take in your hands. Eurgh.

Molesters are sick people of "knowing". As in, mentally sick.

Symptoms allow you to identify the correct sickness.

The most despicable sicknesses make you go numb.

And this one isn't actually "butcher", but rather "consent, approve".

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1355){癒}}}
A cure consents (fixes) the sickness in your heart.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1356){愉}}}
The heart approves of pleasure.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1357){諭}}}
A guide approves of saying.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1358){輸}}}
A car consents transportation.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1359){辟}}}
And lastly, this one is actually "law, rule".

And that's the ones from before my holidays.
