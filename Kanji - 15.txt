Katakana.

I guess you can see the "ト" as sort of pointing outside? People like to go outside during the night?... Something like that.

Holy shitsteaksalamander. 5 Kunyomi? You have GOT to be SHITTONG me. Anyway, the symbol itself is sort of pointing upwards, I guess. It's definitely simple enough to be able to easily memorize it though.

"Early" and "dinner" alone don't fit well together already. Might be another candidate for looks though... Agh, so many in here that I don't know how to find a mnemonic for. At least the "early" itself looks somewhat like a table.

img{} ??? Kinda reminds me of those stereotypical movie fortune tellers, I guess.

Burn the fortune tellers to prove a point. And hey, this fire radical at least also somewhat looks like a cooking fire. Yayers!

Moar pseudo radicals.

It kinda looks like a dude wearing a crown, I guess? Otherwise you could also see it as a dude with a roof over his head. The pointy top could either be a chimney or a result of straightening out what was once ^.

Man, this round was just terrible. I apologize for not being able to come up with anything snappy. Maybe @Isoraqathedh has some ideas.
