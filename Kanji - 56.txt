There's a bunch of easy ones in this, as well as a bunch of stupid ones.

Bamboo stems can be used as pipes, yes. So I guess they're about the same.

If you have... i{administrative matters} to discuss with someone, you better pay them a personal visit.

The administrative stuff is always part of a speech.

I... could not find a unicode character for this, only for [ED: Another character that MySQL hates].

Using the right part as a pictogramm for the veins, this is pretty easy.

Another one I couldn't find a unicode for, only for 袁.

At least the big box around it indicates "park borders". Otherwise I'd much prefer it if it had 木 in it in some fashion.

And YET ANOTHER one I couldn't find the unicode character for! Blimey! This character in particular seems to be quite confusing in how Kanjidamage utilizes it. I am quite annoyed with how wonky this all is.

This just does not work with simply "kick in the nuts" and "beret". There's a missing stroke. It also seems much more like "beret"+"hitchhiker"+"one" to me.

This one is also easier to form a connection with "hitchhiker", since that gives an idea of movement. The master at [movement] is an express.
