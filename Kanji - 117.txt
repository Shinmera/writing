OH BOY HERE WE GO, FINISHING RUN!

Since I left out the one pseudo construct this "depends on", it'll have to be learned directly.

Same with this one.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1592){硬}}}
This here simply means "hard", but as in solid, rather than difficult. The 石 here is a good indicator already.

This is really awkward to draw for some reason.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1596){射}}}
By shooting you can remotely glue metal into people's flesh! Amazing.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1597){謝}}}
After you shot someone, you should go say an apology to them. I mean, you don't want to be rude.
endfloat{}

If I keep it up, I can finish this first iteration before Uni starts.
