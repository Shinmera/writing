Money exists to be used as a bribe. Now you know.

The | is missing from this decomposition.

Same here. I suppose he just grouped them together. Fair enough, as I can't find the unicode character that describes 𠂇 with the extra line.

Again, anything with printing / writing seems to be a bit of trouble to remember.

Ok? Although, now that I look at wiktionary, using the Han's meaning of "lead on to" is probably easier than "crows".

Crows seek warm places during day time. (The sun leads to warm places)

Crows try to assist you by using their wings ass hands. (The hand leads on to assistance)

The crows constantly peck at by string and it becomes loose. (If you pull the string it'll lead on to be loose)

It's a flipped ミ!

I'm a bit disappointed that he didn't choose two different "names" for 彡 and 髪, but I suppose there aren't many good synonyms for hair.

Uuuh, in this scene, your hair produces too much of a shadow. We'll have to edit that.

At least it has "head" in it, so guessing "face" is already a lot easier.

The explanation for the Kunyomi here is.. completely incomprehensible. "When you say まいた！！ it means, to say uncle, or　!No mas!" - What. I think まいた！ means "I'm done / I lost!" or something like that.

Something about a director having mastered hair styling? Idk.

Moar later.
