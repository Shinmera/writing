Man, the symbols are really starting to look complex and messy. I also note rather drastic differences between the fonts that I'm using for my browser.

If your heart condition is only sub-par, it's probably a bad sign. You might wanna get that checked. And hey, now I finally know how to say that I'm feeling like shit! 気持ち悪いです。

Woo, more Katakana that mean stuff and have a different pronunciation as well!

There's many nights. Yeah I couldn't come up with anything better.

This looks quite messy and I actually can't think of a good story to combine the radicals and the meaning.

People like wearing berets late at night.

I'd be happier if this was the symbol for "ice", so I could say "Water turns to ice late at night." But I guess with this I'll have to make up some bullshit and just say "Liquids turn to water at night."

Uuuh. I got nothing for this that isn't excessively retarded. Sorry.

She put up the heels in her shop every evening until the day she died.

I'm still having trouble getting the Kanji and regular Japanese works fit into my daily routines. I really need more hours in the day.
