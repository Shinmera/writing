Looks like a bundle of sticks. Nice.

I'll shun you with these sticks?

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1338){頼}}}
I'll ask you for a favour (or else I'll beat you over the head with my sticks).

Moving on a path of sticks is way faster.

The director arranges everything correctly with a construction of sticks.

On Kanjidamage this is "pass", but I'll call it "path" because that's what it actually means.

If you want to move along the path you need to pass.

Moving along a random path with your feet is called dancing.

Moar later today.
