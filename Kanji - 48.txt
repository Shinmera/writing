I'm having a ridiculously hard time motivating myself for anything, let alone for coming up with smart things to say about Kanji, but I'm currently murdering my eardrums by listening to url(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbqsL2e3NOk){Floating Cloud} on full volume, so wahtever, let's go.

Even the military can't stop these crazy rituals! On a more serious note, I'm pretty sure I'm reading too much into this here, but could it be that historically there was a relation between rituals and the military, such as performing "win the war" customs?

This one only really makes sense in combination with 貸 to me, but I'm quite sure it has its origins elsewhere.

Instead of getting money, you simply lend it! Also, the additional note here is quite interesting. I'm quite sure there's some sociological reasons as to why 貸 means both lending and renting.

I'm quite confused by the name Kanjidamage gave this symbol, but I guess it means "felling a tree"?

Getting into the tree felling club is quite tough. I don't think they'd let any wimps in.

I would imagine that wanting to stab yourself in the heart with a spear is quite a misguided act.

For some reason the Wiktionary page for this makes my Chrome crash, so idk.
