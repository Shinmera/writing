These are all fairly horrible for me, I have no clue how I managed to remember them at all.

The only thing I can come up with here is that it's pictographic for the heel leaning against the person thing, which is far from optimal.

I will take another leap here and say that the "head" on the right looks like a page of text and the 工 symbolizes a span of that text; a paragraph.

Oh hey, one that actually makes sense. How fortunate!

Again going with the "text head" thing on the right, I guess you could see the lines of 川 as sequences of characters.

I guess you could see the dots in between the river lines as islands/states in the ocean or something?

I... suppose you could see this as some kind of dancing guy?... Although the "flower" at the top is a better indicator, as this "wild" isn't for people going party-wild, but rather plants and stuff getting chaotic and growing all over the place.
