I'm going through a slow and painful overhaul of my life situation and am rethinking all the things I want to do and stuff.
Also holidays. So... it's 1AM and I'm writing an entry for 80 Kanjis. I'm already 3 days late and I am pissed. Expect stupidity.

Wheat smells good during the day.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/378){秋}}}
When wheat looks like fire, it's Fall. Or your field is burning.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/385){迷}}}
Sadly I can't come up with a mnemonic for this word. It's sad, because I really like how it's oddly specific.

George Michael hid way in the back of the big rice field.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/399){奇}}}
It's strange how it's possible for big things to unfold. ... I dunno. I wanted to say something along the lines of "Isn't it strange how many little things can cause a huge variety of big results?", but that's obviously way too long and complicated for a mnemonic.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/400){寄}}}

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/457){潔}}}
Personally I disagree with the decomposition of what Kanjidamage has written, as it looks like it's made up of 'string', 'sword', 'waterleft' and 'master'. As for the drink... it's honorable to enjoy a drink of water? Idfk.
