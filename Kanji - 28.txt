Rock radical, I guess.

It looks like the front of a train to me, so not hard to remember, right?

My husband eats rocks for lunch at noon.sup{[Kanjidamage]}

The onlay thing I got here is "Say a word beginning with R".

If you add water and rocks together, you get a swamp. Well... after a couple of millenia perhaps, but y'know.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/293){手}}}
I already knew this, thanks to @isoraqathedh and it does sorta look like an odd, outspread and crippled hand.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/294){択}}}
Select the rock as your weapon of choice.

This one was hard to remember and I sadly don't have anything as a mnemonic.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/296){描}}}
You use your hand to depict (abusing as draw) the field with flowers.

He stretched out his hand and proposed for sure!

I use my hand to pay for the moocow.sup{[Kanjidamage]}

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/298){批}}}
He compared both hands (of the argument) and called bullshit on the left one.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/299){指}}}
The gist of using your finger is to point at things.

I pound a nail with my hand.sup{[Kanjidamage]}

This is another one that I have no smart mnemonic for and was real hard to remember.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/303){拐}}}
He held a sword up to my mouth and said... "Why so serious?!"

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/304){担}}}
旦 sorta looks like a backpack in this, with the cords coming from it and all.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/305){接}}}
If you directly contact a woman with your hand, she'll stand up and call the police.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/306){拍}}}
Well... at least it has the hand radical in it, I guess?

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/307){挿}}}
I got nuthin'

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/308){看}}}
You know how you put your hand above your eyes so you can see farther? Yeah that's what this looks like.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/309){耳}}}
It uh, kinda looks like an ear, I guess?

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/310){取}}}
Take him by the ear, he's been a bad boy again!

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/311){最}}}
The sun is visible most of the day.

He takes his running hobby very seriously.

Got nothing good, unfortunately.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/1748){聞}}}
The ear is the gate to hearing.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/315){斤}}}
It kinda looks like a double wielding axe (the T) is hitting the right side of a tree.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/316){折}}}
You will fold under my powerful axe wielding skillz.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/317){丘}}}
This doesn't look anything like a hill and the radicals make no sense either. Drat.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/318){哲}}}
Philosophy is all about folding words with your mouth to make them sound like more than they are.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/319){誓}}}
Fold yourself (kneel) and say a vow.sup{[Kanjidamage]}

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/320){訴}}}
Say that you accuse him of axe-ing his neighbor!

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/321){竹}}}
Looks like two bamboo canes with leaves at the top. I have no idea where Kanjidamage got the idea for the axe from.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/322){筋}}}
A muscle is an organ as strong as bamboo.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/323){簡}}}
It's very simple to grow bamboo over time. It practically happens by itself!
