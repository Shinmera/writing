Late oh late as always.

Kanjidamage is retarded. This is actually "small table" and makes much more sense that way.

You could either say "he ripped off his moustache and put it on the table as a joke" or think about how it sort of looks like a huge laughing mouth (几 forms the tongue).

The only organ that could engulf an entire table is our skin!

He slammed his hand onto the table and said "I OPPOSE THE BAN ON BERETS!"

Desks are tables made of trees.

I could never remember this one.

If your table is empty you won't be able to eat and will have to starve.

Each table has to be disposed of.

He handed in the evidence to dispose of the criminal.

Tables with a hitch in them are mediocre at best.

Architects craft mediocre tables out of bamboo and trees.

Heart for feeling again. I dread the mediocre products of the industry.

This puts me in a bit of a pickle because even the actual meaning (to kill) of it doesn't actually help much as a compound. It's better in a few and less so in others, but I suppose it would be wiser to use the actual han meaning.

Use your hand to throw the stone and kill the other guy.

His role in the movie was to go and kill the empress!

His downfall was when he fell into the water and got killed by the cliff.

Kill some trees.

If you go into the killing ward, you're guaranteed to get punched.

The organ that eventually kills you is your groin. That's why: Always aim for the groin.

We charged at them in our car with the guns in our hands, ready to kill.

This character is where things in Kanjidamage get really... weird and confusing. I'll try to fix this up a notch, so expect a few changes.

Uuh, I guess it could be seen as a shield with a crest on it?

This one's stupid and dumb and I hate it and screw it. What I'm saying is that I can't remember it.

I've been skipping a few days due to tiredness and lack of motivation. I'll see that I can catch up again with my projected schedule.
