There's some really hard to remember ones in this series. How unfortunate!

I have no idea why I don't have any trouble remembering this one.

The way he uses this as a compund in other symbols makes me uneasy, because it looks very different almost every time.

I cannot agree that 𡗗 is a compound in this. Or at least I cannot see how. These two parts are very much distinct to me.

Spring time is sexy time. Except when it's such an awful spring as this year's.

At least this has pole-looking compounds in it.

I'd rather see this as 宀+主+人.

Why exactly is he calling this "flatflat"? The same question goes for the "glueglue" later.

These ones are kinda stupid and I'm having a real hard time remembering them for some reason.
