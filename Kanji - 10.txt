10'000 formal visits to a restaurant won't prevent you from eating fatty food, but it'll get you in the direction of graduating and bringing your academic career to a halt.
There, a mnemonic for all the words of this day. You can thank me never.

I seriously got nothing for this. But then again, I've had a very exhausting mind and am not very up for creative ideas, so maybe I'll revise this here tomorrow with a mnemonic of some kind, or at least some additional information.

Hey hey hey! Stop right there! You can't stand in front of a restaurant and ogle inside! Get out of here, you creepy stalker!

This sort of looks like some anime face ( ^^ ) with one of these graduation hats or whatever the fuck they're called on top.

I got nothing for this. Sorry.

Heyooo yet again one that looks eerily similar to another character but means something entirely different. I also wonder who came up with using a 10'000 based system in the first place. In fact, I'm entirely unsure how things work for larger numbers. Maybe someone can clear me up on that? (I'd research myself, but y'know.)

Talking with a certain method may be called formal.

Women always prevent you from doing what you want. Hooray for sexism.

Ah, fatty food. So I guess you can't simply use 脂 and "food" to get fatty food. Also, according to the Jukugo here, it appears that you need to use BOTH 脂 (animal fat) AND 肪 (fatty food) to get fat by itself... I'm not even going to bother objecting anymore.

The last two days have just been terrible for me in terms of work load. I apologize deeply for this and hope I can regulate myself better in the future. Being grumpy and tired for the rest of my slim remainder of free time definitely isn't a desired outcome.
