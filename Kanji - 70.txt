Kanjidamage says there's "corpse" in there. That can't be the case because there's an two lines in the radical. Looking at wiktionary, it's apparently a simplification of 食. Which makes more sense. Choosing the 戸 radical (even though it's missing a line) would also make more sense for this in a meaning-way. Roof + door + panel = storage house. Food + house = place where you store food.
