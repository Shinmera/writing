1. Start of the story leaves off a bit after WiiwM ends
  - Haruna is very antsy
  - Yukari notices and tries to assuage her by telling her she loves her and so on
  - Haruna settles a bit, but it's clear she's confused about the level of intimacy that Yukari appreciates
2. Haruna goes to talk to Heather for advice, since Heather knows Yukari for far longer. This would also be a nice parallel to the chapter in WiiwM
  - Heather again reassures her that Yukari wants to be together
  - But also tells her she can't tell her what Yukari wants, they have to figure that out

4. On the second day they relax a lot and take advantage of the outdoors private bath.
  - Seeing each other naked gets them both a bit steamed.
  - Yukari gets close to Haruna in the bath, kisses her a little bit, and starts petting her.
  - Haruna enjoys it, but gets scared she might inadvertently go too far and pushes Yukari away.
  - Yukari feels wounded for being rejected. They both feel awkward and Yukari excuses herself to go cool off.
5. It's evening now and Yukari is sitting by herself thinking in the lobby. She overhears a couple arguing and is initially annoyed.
  - The couple rags on about not understanding what the other wants.
  - Yukari has an epiphany and realises that she hasn't been clear with Haruna.
  - As she returns to the room she overhears Haruna talking on the phone
  - Haruna is scared she fucked up again and is bawling to Heather on the phone.
6. Yukari feels the urgency of the situation and understands she has to be clear and open about her boundaries
  - They both sit down to talk and Yukari comforts Haruna first
  - Then she very awkwardly broaches the topic of sex and intimacy
  - Haruna perks up and is very intrigued. She prods Yukari on some details.
  - Yukari is very embarrassed but relents and answers Haruna's questions openly.
  - They end the conversation with a kiss and go for dinner
7. It's the last day. They're both very comfortable and very much in the mood now.
  - They cuddle in bed and sleep in.
  - A brunch follows where they feed each other and chat.
  - In the afternoon they check out the large public bath.
  - Yukari gets flustered again and after a while timidly asks Haruna if they can go back to their room.
8. Back in the room. It's the climax of the story. [butthead voice] uh-huhuhuh
9. Next morning they have to return back home.
  - Both wish they could have stayed longer.
  - On the train back home they both feel noticeably closer to each other
  - An old lady on the train remarks that they look like great friends
