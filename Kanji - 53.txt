Now then, on to Kanji.

I like that this contains 孝, it's really fitting imo.

This one is a bitch to remember...

I have to say, I never watched many Bugs Bunny cartoons (I was forbidden from watching cartoons for a long time and didn't have CN at home) and then there's a language barrier, so unfortunately this name isn't helping me at all.

So Bugs Bunny is the director now? Alright.

Running around is a pretty suitable activity for cartoons.

Hm, how did this evolve? I could well imagine this having been some kind of loop squiggle or something else before it reached this form.

We're refining the script a bit.

I have to run myself out of bed sometimes.

A diary is basically a way to talk to oneself. Very nice.

I myself distribute liquor to get everyone else drunk.

Where does the extra dot in the top right come from?

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/726){救}}}
The director demands to be rescued before his crew. What a douchebag.

The king demands to see a perfect sphere.

Fair enough.

Groves can stop a cliff from advancing (the roots hold the ground together), so I'm imagining some epic scenario with a cliff in my head that would certainly be part of a chronicle. It's a pretty roundabout way to memorise it, but it seems to work.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/732){厚}}}
Stupid children and their thick heads, why can't they realise that walking off a cliff is not a good idea?

I ran out of cards, apparently... I'll buy more tomorrow and will have to do yet another double entry.
