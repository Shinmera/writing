So... I'll talk about my revision at the end of the entry. For now, have the last 16 Kanji.

Put the hook into the nose and then drag that bastard over!

Reminds me of an arrow hitting a target sign, viewed from above.

I couldn't find a unicode character for this, but it already looks very similar to 市, so idk.

Taking a look at the url(http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%A9%A6){Wiktionary page} makes this (and the following one) much more sensible, as the part on the right is a symbol for "broom".

Hand+Broom=Sweep. Woo.

It's unfortunate that I don't have much to say about all the Kanji anymore.

Regarding Kanjidamage's self-compliment: It is a good-enough Kanji teaching system, I suppose. I'd like to believe that there are better alternatives out there though, as Kanjidamage does leave quite a couple of things to wish for.

I feel like I'm sort of betraying you (the reader) for not being able to come up with anything interesting to say about the chatacters.

This mutant Kanji makes things ridiculously crowded... Just look at this mess: img{http://shinmera.tymoon.eu/public/Screenshot_2013-03-04_212244_001_.png}

Am I seeing things or didn't we encounter this in a previous Kanji already?

Alrighty then, the revision.
It went... quite badly, if I dare say so myself. This is mostly due to me being a lazy ass and only revising the entire stack once (I revised smallers stacks of it until I could all of them though). Since I only did it once, I'm bound to have forgotten most of them again, which makes this all quite redundant. I was also quite astounded at how little I actually remembered. It seemed to be well below 50%, which is really, really disappointing. I need to step up my game if I ever want to beat this bet...
