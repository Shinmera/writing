I couldn't do these at the times I wanted to because I ran out of cards. So, double the effort today.
Post-pre-edit: I actually didn't have the energy to study them that day, so that got pushed out to today as well.

Wait, what does "site" have to do with "laying out"?

It kinda looks like a canvas, I guess?

Both plants are full with water.

Oddly enough the メ+凵 combination gets turned into a radical (凶) later on, but not here. It even makes sense to use it here: Divocrve from your turkey is terrible!

It sort of looks like a drawer being pulled out (from a top-down perspective).

If you just pull on the corpse, it'll yield quickly.

I guess it sort of looks like a can? Since this is purely chosen by phonetics though, it's pretty obvious that there's no connection to the meaning otherwise.

Losers fall into the pit of society.

I don't think the 世 is here for any meaning in this case. Tree and flower are pretty good indicators though, so it isn't too much of a hassle.

Here I would suggest thinking of it as 世+木+口, rather than 口+葉. In society, the mouth speaks.

I am fairly sure that this was a pictogram at some point. It looks like a shovel-tooth with the roots at the top.

You use the teeth in your mouth to bite!

I'll post the Kanji for today along with tomorrow's to split it up a bit.
