Yay, a number Kanji I didn't know.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/230){舌}}}
A thousand mouthes all have a tongue.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/231){話}}}
You need to speak with your tongue for a coversation.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/232){活}}}
Drinking water makes you vivid.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/233){辞}}}
Quit being so damn odd, Kanji. Why is this a compound for dictionary?

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/234){憩}}}
Uuuh, I guess if you take a break, you can stick your tongue out and take a deep breath to calm your heart?...

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/186){半}}}
Nothing to say here.

One half of the sword is judgement. The other kills you.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/190){伴}}}
Something like: Without anyone to accompany you, you're only half the person.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/187){平}}}
It's a bitch that it looks very similar to 半, but yeah. What'cha gonna do.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/189){評}}}
If you speak about comparing it to an equal level, you get critique. Or something.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/191){呼}}}
I can't figure this one out. It's one of those that will probably give me trouble forever.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/235){土}}}
Sorta upsetting that it's so close to 上, but hey, whatever.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/236){里}}}
Earth and rice fields is all you need for a village.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/237){量}}}
There's usually a greant quantity of husbands in a village.... ugh this is a terrible mnemonic.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/238){黒}}}
Uuuh, I guess if you burn a village to the ground all that remains is black coal?

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/239){童}}}
Hm, so what's the historical difference between this and 子? I see that the Kunyomi at least has some difference in meaning, but still.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/240){憧}}}
My heart yearns for my kid.sup{[Kanjidamage]}

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/241){埋}}}
The earth next to the village is where they bury their beloved ones.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/242){坊}}}
I'm a bit confused (and slightly worried) by the fact that both "boy" and "monk" are listed as meanings here.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/243){吐}}}
The contents go from your mouth to the ground. 

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/244){塾}}}
This looks like a buttload of characters crammed together. Unfortunately that's not a very reliable way to remember it, but it's the only way I have.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/245){士}}}
Wow hey, surely this is another Kanji that totally cannot be confused with anything else.

endfloat{}float(left){size(46){url(http://kanjidamage.com/kanji/246){仕}}}
SHE is a person who works as a samurai.sup{[Kanjidamage]}
