The first eight were extremely confusing me when I first wrote them up. I can safely blame the fontset for that though, as now that I see it on my workstation it's much clearer what's going on. Regardless, this is still one of the hardest bunch I've had, so my commentary will be sparse at best.

I wish these "the fly" compounds were easier to explain, but alas...

If you have tree shortage, go plant some.

This actually means "bad, vicious", so I'm going to call it that because it's just as helpful as a compounf as "shhh" would be, but it has the additional bonus of actually being correct.

What the hell. Why does the composition say this contains 歹? This is just mouth plus "sword" twice. And two sowrds are good at separating things.

The first row of soldats is serving as an example. ... I don't fucking know.
